      <article>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one <br> quite like it. It will always
        be my favorite and has won me several first place <br> prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
        favorites as well!

      <h3><i>Directions</i></h3>
     <li>
       <ol>1 - Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in<br>
         flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce <br>
         temperature and let simmer.</ol>
       <ol>2 - Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a<br>
         lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so <br>
         that it does not run off.</ol>
       <ol>3 - Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175<br>
         degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</ol>
